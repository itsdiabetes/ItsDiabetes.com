First and foremost, the system is broken. While these patchwork solutions are critical for insulin dependent diabetics, it is no substitute for universal healthcare system. Access to insulin is a human right.

> <p>Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.</p><p><i><a class="href-no-color" href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Article 25, Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a></i></p>


While these solutions may assist with affording insulin, a valid prescription is still necessary for modern analog insulins. To secure a prescription, visiting a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) is likely be the go-to solution due to sliding-fee scale and comprehensive services mandates. These comprehensive services will often include chronic care management, including diabetes. Likewise, FQHCs will frequently be 340B Covered Entities, primary care facilitators, and governmental assistance outreach liaisons. If you lost your insurance and are uncertain how to proceed, you should immediately contact a local FQHC.

If you already have a valid prescription, patient assistance programs (PAPs) are what you are likely seeking. These programs are often operated by pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide assistance for low-income and recently uninsured consumers. While these corporations are innately <i>for-profit</i>, you are no longer a consumer if dead so these corporations have a shared interest: keeping you alive.

These pharmaceutical manufacturers will work with you to secure affordable access to insulin. While there exists tons of individual programs, such as Val<i>you</i> Savings Program and NovoLog® Savings Card, these PAPs should be the initial contact for affording insulin as they will have the most recent and up-to-date information. Likewise, if ineligible for direct manufacturer assistance, these organizations will redirect to the most appropriate solution. This solutions may include resources not readily apparent online, such as local charities or region-specific aid programs.
